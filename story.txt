there once was a boy named joel. He had a family of three in france. 
his father, mother and sister fell ill to the bubanic plague. first his 
dad died, then his mother. He was tending to his ill sister when he heard a 
knock at the door... 

Joel opened the door a crack, revealing a tall robed figure. Unable to see 
the man's face, he asked "What do you want? And make it quick. My sister is sick
and I must tend to her." "Well Joel," the man replied, "that won't be 
necessary. You see, I am Death. You were asleep when I came for you mother and
father."

"Death? What the heck? What kind of name is that? Let me guess, your brother's name
is Life? Ha ha," Joel joked. "Actually...yes, yes his name is that. How'd you know?"
Death asked. "Actually don't answer that. I came here to tell you two things. Would you
like to hear the good news first? Or the bad news?" Joel thought long and hard for a 
good 2 seconds. "Hmmm, you know what, give me the good news first."
